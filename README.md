## Investigating Fadango Movie Ratings
In October 2015, Walt Hickey from FiveThirtyEight published a popular article where he presented strong evidence which suggest that Fandango's movie rating system was biased and dishonest. In this project, we'll analyze the latest movie ratings data to determine whether Fandango's rating system reflected Hickey's critics or not.

The codes are written in the Jupyter notebook **'investigating_fandango_movie_ratings.ipynb'**. Please refer to this file.
